Sphinx extension for building self-hosted versioned docs.

This is a Zuar fork of the original `sphinx-multiversion`, which
lives here:  https://holzhaus.github.io/sphinx-multiversion/

The fork is necessary to add support for `smv_prebuild_command` which
is not yet available in the original repo.  It also adds a couple of
other values that can be used with template expansion.
